# Lab 2a Your very first Python code (PRACTICE LAB)
## a. Print the following statements using multiple print() statements
```python
print("All the world's a stage,")print("And all the men and women merely players:")
print("They have their exits and their entrances;")
print("And one man in his time plays many parts,")
print("His acts being seven ages.")
```
## b. Print the above statements using a single print() statement
```python
print("All the world's a stage, And all the men and women merely players:They have their exits and their entrances;And one man in his time plays many parts, His acts being seven ages.")
```
## c. Without coding, what is the output of the following statement: print("127","0","0","1",sep=".")
Without coding, the output is 127.0.0.1

## d. Identify a situation where you have to print data with flush=True and flush=False.
When using flush=True, you are asking for an output immediately. However, with flush=False, it is used to print something normal. 

## e. By default, the flush is disabled but print() output behaves like flush=True. Which argument triggers the flush?
flush=True triggers the flush. 

# Challenge(s) 
The only main challenge I encountered during this lab was how to make a mark down file and overall setting up this assignment to submit.
